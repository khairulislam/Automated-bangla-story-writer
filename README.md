# Bengali AI Writer
This AI learns from writers previous literature, then given some text 
it can continue generating the rest as the writer would have written.
I have added code, best models, also tokenizers for 2 prominent bengali 
writers: rabindranath Tagore and Humayun Ahmed. 

Note that the models aren't trained much to reduce overfiting, as the dataset
is pretty small.
